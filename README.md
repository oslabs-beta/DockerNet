## About
>### Description
>DockerNet.io provides developers with the tools needed to visualize and manage a Docker Network.  Developers will have the abaility to view their networks in both a list view and graphical view.  Developers are also able to create new networks, delete current networks, add containers to a network, and remove containers from a network.
>
>DockerNet's interface allows users to easily and seemlessly navigate between networks.  This feature proves most useful during the early development of a Docker Network configuration.  
>
>DockerNet is designed to be used by Developers who are new to the "Docker-verse" and appreciate having a visual aid.  It also benefits seasoned developers who are designing a Docker Compose configuration as well as a means of verifiying a Docker compose file is correctly configured and behaving as expected.
